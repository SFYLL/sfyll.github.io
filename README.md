# sfyl website


Inspired from the amazing https://til.pm & 2Î».com.

## UPDATES:
- Migrated to Vue3
- Clean headers + menu for mobile version (with help of [leobnt](https://github.com/leobnt))
- Background handle transparant image bugs for blog-posts
- Simplistic About Me Version, portfolio type
- Many other format difference
- Add Metatags support for social network sharing

## TODOs:
- Find a way to transition color-switch on the iOS top-bar (can't use keyframe).
- Use dynamic meta-tag for better social-network rendering. Issue is web-crawlers don't seem to like website rendered in the front-end, and our html is pretty bare until rendered by vue.
