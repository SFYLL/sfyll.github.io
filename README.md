# sfyl website


Inspired from the amazing https://til.pm & 2Î».com.

## Updates:
- Migrated to Vue 3
- Refined headers and mobile menu (with assistance from [leobnt](https://github.com/leobnt))
- Fixed transparent image bugs in blog post
- Introduced a simplistic "About Me" section, akin to a portfolio
- Numerous formatting improvements
- Added support for meta tags to enhance social network sharing

## TODOs:
- Implement color-switch transition for the iOS top bar (keyframes are not an option).
- Utilize dynamic meta tags for improved social media rendering. Challenge: web crawlers don't favor frontend-rendered websites, and our HTML is bare until rendered!.
